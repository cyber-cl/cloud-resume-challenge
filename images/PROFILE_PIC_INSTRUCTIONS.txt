PROFILE PICTURE INSTRUCTIONS

To add your own profile picture:

1. Prepare your image:
   - Use a square image (ideally 400x400 pixels)
   - Make sure it has good lighting and a clean background
   - Save it as PNG or JPG format

2. Name your file:
   - Save your image as "profile-pic.png" 

3. Add to the images folder:
   - Place the file in the "images" directory of your project

4. Test your website:
   - Refresh your browser to see your profile picture displayed
   - The image will be automatically cropped to a circle

Note: If your image appears distorted, try using a perfectly square image.
